## KPI's Requirement
The primary KPIs required for this project are Total Sales, Total Orders, Total Profit, and Average Ship Days. Other key metrics include sales and profit broken down by category, region, and time to identify trends and performance drivers.
## Preject flow process
The project flow process for a Power BI dashboard involves:
Planning: Defining objectives and KPIs.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming raw data in Power Query.
Data Modeling: Creating relationships between tables and writing DAX formulas.
Visualization: Designing the dashboard with charts and filters.
Insights & Reporting: Analyzing the data and publishing the final report
### Data Collection
Data collection is the essential first step of any project, where you gather all the raw information needed for your analysis. For this dashboard, that means sourcing your sales, customer, and product data from files like a spreadsheet or CSV to begin the process.
### Data Cleaning
Removed null values and duplicates.
Formatted date fields, corrected item categories, and standardized rating formats.
Ensured consistency across outlet sizes, locations, and product labels
### Data Transformation
Data transformation is the crucial process of cleaning and structuring raw data to make it useful. This involves activities like removing duplicates, correcting data types, and creating new columns to prepare the information for accurate analysis and visualization.
### Data Modeling
Data modeling is the process of creating a connected data structure within Power BI by building relationships between different tables. This allows you to write DAX formulas for key metrics (measures) like total sales and profit, ensuring all your visualizations work together correctly
### Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of creating a graphical representation of data using charts, graphs, and maps. The goal is to make complex information easy to understand at a glance, allowing users to quickly identify trends and insights from the dashboard's visuals
### Insights & Reporting
This is the final and most crucial stage where I analyzed the visualizations to uncover meaningful insights. It's about turning the data into actionable knowledge. I then created a report to communicate these findings clearly to stakeholders. The goal is to provide recommendations based on the data, enabling the business to make smarter, data-driven decisions.
